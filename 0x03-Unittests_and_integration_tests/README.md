# Python Testing Project

This project demonstrates the use of **unit tests** and **integration tests** in Python using the built-in `unittest` framework, as well as external tools like `parameterized` and `unittest.mock`.

## Features

- Unit testing of utility functions with standard and edge cases
- Use of parameterized tests for multiple input scenarios
- Documentation and type annotations for clarity and maintainability
- Mocking of external dependencies in tests

## Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Run the test file with:
